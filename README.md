# CodeBy Test

Hi! If you're here that means you need to be tested, right? Okay, let's get started then. First, install react and vtex using npm. Now take a quick look at VTEX IO Framework documentation if you are not already familiar with that: [Docs](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-io-getting-started). Last but not least, one more thing that will help on your test is the `vtex-apps` repository [(here)](https://github.com/vtex-apps/), which holds all the IO apps built by them. If you have any questions or doubts, first refer to the docs, then to the repository and last, to me.

# What we need?

We need you to build an **Store Locator**. The store locator will work as follows:

 - User selects delivery type: pickup-in-point or delivery
 - User inserts address
 - Store locator will automatically find the best store for the user according to the delivery type & address
 - In case of delivery, store locator shall set the sales channel accordingly, select the store and save the information on the OrderForm.
 - In case of pickup, select the closest and best store and save to the OrderForm
 - The store locator shall have the option to select previously saved addresses and add new addresses
 - The store locator shall have a map integrated with Google Maps that shows the address selected and the store selected according to each step and delivery type
 - The address of the store selected that will ship to the user needs to be visible somewhere every page
 - The user needs to have the ability to locate another store whenever he wants while navigating through the store
 - Good luck & have fun!

## What should you use?

React, Google Maps API and VTEX IO framework.

## Where can you test this?

Just email me asking for a workspace and access to the Codeby store. **jean@codeby.com.br**
